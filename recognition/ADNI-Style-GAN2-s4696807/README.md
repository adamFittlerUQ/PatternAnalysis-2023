# Brain Image Generation
My model will attempt to produce accurate looking brain images using the ADNI brain dataset

## Project Structure
- `modules.py`: Source code for model components.
- `dataset.py`: Data loader and preprocessing.
- `train.py`: Training, validation, testing, and model saving.
- `predict.py`: Example usage of the trained model.

## How to Use
Explain how to set up and run your code, including dependencies and configurations.

## Model Details
Describe your generative model and its architecture in detail.

## Results
Include any visualizations or results from your model, if applicable.

## Acknowledgments
Give credit to any third-party code or libraries used in your project.

## Todo List
- Change the model to not use RGB and just grayscale to reduce the training time as model will require less 
- Add a graph of the loss of each epoch and print loss each epoch 
- Work on report read me 
- Manipulate the style vector and show the affect of the final results of the model to show how model works
